## Features

### Easy card linking

Link any card from either Hearthstone or Magic with '@cardname' and autocomplete.  Toggle the autocomplete game by clicking on the MTG / Hearthstone Icon.

### Inline card tooltips

Use a card name with tooltip in any sentence by typing [mtg::cardname] for Magic cards and [hs::cardname] for Hearthstone cards.  For example:

```
I ate a [mtg::black lotus], pooped a [mtg::lotus petal], and went [mtg::berserk].
```

### Easy deck linking via URL

GGMessenger automatically expands decks from URLs that it recognizes.  Currently, it supports:

###### MTG

* [MTGTop8](http://mtgtop8.com)
* [MTGGoldfish](http://mtggoldfish.com)
* [MTGSalvation](http://mtgsalvation.com)
* [Channel Fireball](http://channelfireball.com)

###### Hearthstone
* [HearthPwn](http://hearthpwn.com)
* [HearthHead](http://hearthhead.com)

### Work in progress

Other features in the works (but not quite done yet...)

* Linking / importing deck from Hearthstone or MTGO client (PC only)
* TCGPlayer pricing next to card names.
* Support for more amazing games.  If you have any suggestions, let me know!
