## Features

### Card Linking

Link *any* card from MTG or Hearthstone by sending `[cardname]`, or you can inline cards with tooltips:

```
I heard they were reprinting [Force of Will] and [Wasteland] in EMA!
```

GGMessenger supports both tab / click autocomplete for all cards.  To switch the autocomplete, simply click the icon left of the keyboard.

### Easily Share Deck Lists

You can share your current draft deck from MTGO by simply exporting it as a DEK file, and drag-and-drop into the chat window!

GGMessenger also automatically expands decks from many external URLs.  Currently, it supports:
